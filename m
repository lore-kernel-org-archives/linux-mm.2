Since you asked "why bother", here's how I ran into it.

The patch actually came from a production incident rather than a code
audit.

A maintenance script on a cluster accidentally wrote an unset variable
into memory.max of a workload cgroup. The write succeeded, and the
workload in the cgroup was subsequently OOM-killed. There was no
indication that the successful write had caused it, so it took quite
some time to trace the OOMs back to that script.

When I checked the documentation, I noticed that the cpuset controller
explicitly documents the semantics of empty writes ("An empty value
indicates that the cgroup is using the same setting as the nearest
cgroup ancestor..."), while the memory controller documentation says
nothing about empty input.

I reproduced the same behavior in isolation on a Kubernetes cluster
(v1.29, cgroup v2, two-container pod, 384M pod limit):

  # LIMIT=
  # echo "$LIMIT" > $CG/memory.max
  # echo $?
  0

  m6demo   0/2     OOMKilled   0

  oom-kill: constraint=CONSTRAINT_MEMCG,
            oom_memcg=/kubepods.slice/.../kubepods-burstable-pod....slice
  Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process 339529 (sleep) ...
            anon-rss:32kB, file-rss:452kB

The process selected by the OOM killer had less than 1 MB resident
under a 384M pod limit, but the empty write was accepted as 0,
immediately triggering a memcg OOM. From the caller's perspective, the
write simply succeeded.

One caveat is that kubelet reconciles the pod-level memory.max within
seconds, so the window is short there, although container-level files
are not reconciled.

So the patch came out of that incident and the documentation gap it
exposed. My thinking was that rejecting an empty input would make such
mistakes fail immediately instead of silently changing the limit to 0.

Whether that benefit outweighs the compatibility risk is not mine to
decide. If it doesn't, then documenting the current empty-write
behavior, similar to cpuset, would also address the ambiguity that led
me to investigate this in the first place.

Thanks,
Tao
