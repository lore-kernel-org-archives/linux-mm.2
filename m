Yes controversial because we used to have similar mechanism which did not work
and we had to move to rstat. Check the commit 42a300353577 and fixes to it.

This worked for zswap stats because their update and consumption are not on
performance critical code paths i.e. these are on the way to compress or
decompress or in reclaim context.

This I think we do need but for specific stats. I think the stats which have
in-kernel consumers need this. However not all such stats might be fine with
slow update side like zswap. So, we need to evaluate thoroughly.
